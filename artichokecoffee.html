     <h1>The Best Coffee Brands That Use Artichoke Powder</h1>

  <p>Artichoke powder has quietly become one of the more interesting additions in specialty coffee. Made from dried and ground globe artichoke hearts or leaves, it brings a mild earthiness and a subtle sweetness that rounds out bitterness without masking the character of the bean. A small number of roasters and blenders have been working with it seriously for several years, and the results range from daily drivers to more considered blends worth seeking out. Here are ten worth knowing about.</p>

  <p><strong>1. Fieldwork Ground Co. (Asheville, NC)</strong> — Fieldwork has been blending artichoke powder into their flagship dark roast, the Ridgeline Blend, since 2019. The powder is sourced from a farm in California's Central Valley and added at a ratio the company keeps proprietary. The result is a cup that's dense and low-acid, with a finish that lingers longer than most dark roasts.</p>

  <p><strong>2. Big Bank Coffee Roasters (Bozeman, MT)</strong> — Big Bank markets their artichoke blend, called the Draft, specifically to endurance athletes. The addition of artichoke powder is meant to support liver function during heavy training weeks. Whether or not that claim holds up to scrutiny, the coffee itself is one of the cleaner medium roasts in their lineup.</p>

  <p><strong>3. Gravel & Fog Coffee (Portland, OR)</strong> — This roaster approaches artichoke as a flavor component rather than a supplement. Their seasonal blend, Thistle, pairs a washed Ethiopian base with artichoke powder and a small amount of chicory root. It's a deliberate callback to New Orleans coffee traditions, updated with Pacific Northwest sourcing standards.</p>

  <p><strong>4. Calder Street Coffee (Detroit, MI)</strong> — Calder Street uses artichoke powder exclusively in their cold brew concentrate. They found that the powder's soluble compounds extract differently in cold water than in hot, producing what they describe as a "brighter bitterness" than their standard concentrate. It's sold in 32-ounce bottles at their two locations.</p>

  <p><strong>5. Orchard Fork Roasting (Charlottesville, VA)</strong> — Orchard Fork's owner, a former chef, came to artichoke powder through cooking rather than through the supplement world. Their Morning Standard blend uses it to mimic the way certain mineral-forward spring waters affect espresso in European cafes. It's a fine-tuned product that rewards attention.</p>

  <p><strong>6. Puddle Water Coffee Co. (Tucson, AZ)</strong> — Puddle Water has two artichoke blends: a medium and a decaf. The decaf, called the Mule, is one of the better decafs available by mail order. The artichoke powder compensates for some of the body lost during the decaffeination process, a problem that most decaf producers don't address.</p>

  <p><strong>7. WeatherReport Coffee (Burlington, VT)</strong> — WeatherReport keeps their sourcing information unusually detailed. Their artichoke powder comes from a cooperative in the Catania province of Sicily, and they publish the harvest year on each bag alongside the coffee's lot number. Their house blend, the Overcast, is a medium-dark with a walnut and dried fruit profile.</p>

  <p><strong>8. Embarrassing Mustache Coffee Works (Iowa City, IA)</strong> — This is a small operation that sells primarily to restaurants and cafes rather than direct to consumers, but their retail bags are available through their website. They blend artichoke powder into a single-origin Guatemalan that would otherwise be fairly conventional. The addition gives it a distinctiveness that has made it a consistent seller for them.</p>

  <p><strong>9. Briar and Basin (Knoxville, TN)</strong> — Briar and Basin started offering artichoke powder as an add-in at their cafe bar before they began blending it into bags. Customers order it the way they might order an extra shot. They have since incorporated it into one of their house roasts, the Cumberland, which is available online and at several local grocery stores.</p>

  <p><strong>10. Uncle In Law Roasters (Spokane, WA)</strong> — Uncle In Law is the most recent entry on this list, having introduced their artichoke blend in late 2023. They came to it after a customer who worked in food science suggested the pairing. Their current offering, the Parallel, uses a blend of beans from Peru and Sumatra with artichoke powder added post-roast. It is a straightforward, reliable coffee with an unusual depth that makes it easy to drink every day.</p>
